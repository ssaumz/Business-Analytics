## Business Analytics Internship

## Project Overview
This project aims to understand and visualise the dataset structure, analyze and build a model to determine the investment choices. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training a machine learning model for prediction.

## Project Description
The project involves the following tasks:

**[Level 1: Beginner]**

**Task 1: Data Overview**

Objective: Understand the dataset structure.
Steps:
1. data analysis tool such as Python with pandas or spreadsheet software.
2. Descriptive Statistics: Use descriptive functions (e.g., info() in pandas) to gather information about the number of entries, columns, and data types.

**Task 2: Gender Distribution**

Objective: Visualize gender distribution in the dataset.
Steps:
1. Extract Gender Information: Identify and extract the gender column from the dataset.
2. Visualization: Create a simple visualization, such as a bar chart or pie chart, to represent the distribution of genders in the dataset.


**[Level 2: Intermediate]**

**Task 3: Descriptive Statistics**

Objective: Present basic statistics for numerical columns.
Steps:
1. Identify Numerical Columns: Review the dataset to identify columns containing numerical data (e.g., age, income).
2. Calculations: Use statistical functions (e.g., mean(), median(), std()) to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation for each numerical column.


**[Level 3: Advanced]**

**Task 5: Reasons for Investment**

Objective: Analyze and summarize reasons for investment choices.
Steps:
1. Explore Reasons Column: Investigate the column where participants provided reasons for their investment choices.
2. Summarize Reasons: Identify common themes or recurring reasons and provide a summary.


**[Level 4: Expert]**

**Task 7: Common Information Sources**

Objective: Analyze common sources participants rely on for investment information.
Steps:
1. Explore Information Sources Column: Review the column where participants indicated their sources of investment information.
2. Identify Common Sources: Analyze the data to identify and summarize the most common sources participants rely on.
